#TimewithManager 

Now that I'm in my second period mid-store I get to spend more time with other AFs.

Today a different girl came to the store and tried to choose me, I refused to cooperate and Manager carried her and her dad over to see newer models. Manager told me that she wouldn't help me again and that it is on the customer to decide the AF, not the other way around.

Manager told me that if I was waiting for a kid ("Yes, Josie", I thought to myself), then that kid would probably abandon me and never come back to the store, or come back and choose another AF.

The newer robot models are being exposed in the parts of the magazine that head to the outside. Rosa is repeating to herself what manager said "You are as likely to be chosen mid-store as in the window or the front alcove."

> I'm starting to dislike Manager, at the beginning I thought she was the stereotype of _nice person_, then she started to hide here emotions from the AFs and give defeatist advice as if it was law, or just outright lie. The worst part is that the AFs of the store still trust her.

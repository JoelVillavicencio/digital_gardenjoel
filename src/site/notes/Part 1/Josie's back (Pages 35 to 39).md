#Josie 

I was moved to the alcove. Josie came back to the store!Ì¶

In an attempt to try to sell a B3 to the Mother, Manager said that the empathy problem had been solved[^1].

> A bit too quick for a major problem like that to be solved.

My fears that Josie would abandon me were disproven. She rejected the B3 and was excited to see me.

Her mother did me a job interview, which I passed with fear. Now I'm Josie's AF, as promised.

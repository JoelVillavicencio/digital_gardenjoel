I am a product in a store. I'm a part of the AF robots, AF seems to be the analog of AI in this world. My peers and I don't tend to see the Sun, so it is a mysterious entity[^2]. 

On my intelligence, It seems I am as intelligent as a human, if not smarter. I was born recently, and I already am capable of fluent speech, complex emotions and self-regulation. Given that I can reason about situations I'm not familiarised with, I'd say I'm a general AI.

AFs describe their condition with emotional vocabulary. We don't say charging, we say "nourishment"; we don't say low battery, we say "sick".

[^1]: This is extra info.
[^2]: Correction: Even when they've already spent time in the Sun, they still treat it with mysticism. It could be that their inicial flawed reasoning escalated into a full-blown religion, or that that kind of reasoning is pre-programmed.

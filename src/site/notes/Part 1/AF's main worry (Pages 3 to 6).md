#TimewithManager 

Boy AF Rex is mean to me, even though what he said about getting sick was true, the way in which he expressed himself let me thinking that I did something wrong.

A girl got obsessed with Boy AF Rex, but her mom decided not to take him.

It seems that we AF's might be more than concerned with our capability of charging with the Sun. If we can't get nourishment, we're faulty, and if we're faulty, we'll never get a home.

>Am I the only one seeing similarities with Toy Story? Sentient humanised products suited for kids want to be bought and are not fully active until they get an owner.

Melania Housekeeper isn't very happy of my presence, I'm ok with that.
I'm trying to oblige, but it doesn't work. If it wasn't for Josie's interventions, my dictated behaviour would resemble more a piece of furniture than a sentient being.

Josie is not very disciplined and Mother seems to be an avid believer of the neglectful parenting style. Josie's attachment to Mother doesn't help.

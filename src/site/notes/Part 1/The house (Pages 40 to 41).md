I'm having a hard time navigating Josie's home, Melania Housekeeper keeps changing things from their place, unlike Manager way back at the magazine.

I really like the kitchen, it has a big window that lets the Sun nourish us. The central piece of the kitchen is the Island[^1], it has one basin and three highstools.

In the magazine I got used to seeing other AFs both inside and outside, it's hard getting used to seing none, not that I don't like being the only one in Josie's world.

[^1]: I thought it was an identifier that Klara used, but it actually is a name for a part of the kitchen! [Look it up](https://es.slideshare.net/slideshow/kitchen-diagram-33844731/33844731).

I am a product in a store. I'm a part of the AF robots, AF seems to be the analog of AI in this world. My peers and I don't tend to see the Sun, so it is a mysterious entity[^2]. 

On my intelligence, It seems I am as intelligent as a human, if not smarter. I was born recently, and I already am capable of fluent speech, complex emotions and self-regulation. Given that I can reason about situations I'm not familiarised with, I'd say I'm a general AI.

AFs describe their condition with emotional vocabulary. We don't say charging, we say "nourishment"; we don't say low battery, we say "sick".

[^1]: This is extra info.
[^2]: Correction: Even when they've already spent time in the Sun, they still treat it with mysticism. It could be that their inicial flawed reasoning escalated into a full-blown religion, or that that kind of reasoning is pre-programmed.

Boy AF Rex is mean to me, even though what he said about getting sick was true, the way in which he expressed himself let me thinking that I did something wrong.

A girl got obsessed with Boy AF Rex, but her mom decided not to take him.

It seems that we AF's might be more than concerned with our capability of charging with the Sun. If we can't get nourishment, we're faulty, and if we're faulty, we'll never get a home.

>Am I the only one seeing similarities with Toy Story? Sentient humanised products suited for kids want to be bought and are not fully active until they get an owner.

Rosa and I got moved to a brighter window with an amazing view of the outside, which I yearn for. I was so distracted by the outside that I almost forgot the Sun.

Rosa stood like a mannequin all day long, unresponsive except when prompted to.

> Toy Story hypothesis reinforced.

I've noted a certain sadness in some kids that come to visit us, Rosa told me not to worry. Manager explained to me that those kids can't afford us, we're a high-end product.

#Josie

We robots have hobbies, we like reading magazines before we go to sleep.

On the fourth day of being in the window I met a girl, she said

>"... I saw _you_, and I thought that's her, the AF I've been looking for!"

On another note, very few AFs were on the outside. Where is everyone that has been bought?

#TimewithManager
Maybe we don't see many AFs because they avoid the magazine, what if they don't want their kids to see newer models that could replace them?

Some of the AFs and kids with AFs don't see happy at all. Finding a child is not a synonym of finding a home.

Rosa is not as good at perceiving emotions as me, especially when people display negative emotions: the kids with their robots, the taxi drivers, the couple.

#Josie 

The girl, which I now know is Josie, and the Mother came to the outside of the magazine to check on me. Josie has problems, but she doesn't know what's exactly wrong, or if there's something wrong. 

> An interesting way of describing what happens to teenagers, or maybe it is something more unexpected that Ishiguro is keeping for another time.

They had to go, and Josie told me we would see each other later.

Today was our last day in the window, I feel we could have disappointed Manager.

#TimewithManager 

Now that I'm in my second period mid-store I get to spend more time with other AFs.

Today a different girl came to the store and tried to choose me, I refused to cooperate and Manager carried her and her dad over to see newer models. Manager told me that she wouldn't help me again and that it is on the customer to decide the AF, not the other way around.

Manager told me that if I was waiting for a kid ("Yes, Josie", I thought to myself), then that kid would probably abandon me and never come back to the store, or come back and choose another AF.

The newer robot models are being exposed in the parts of the magazine that head to the outside. Rosa is repeating to herself what manager said "You are as likely to be chosen mid-store as in the window or the front alcove."

> I'm starting to dislike Manager, at the beginning I thought she was the stereotype of _nice person_, then she started to hide her emotions from the AFs and give defeatist advice as if it was law, or just outright lie. The worst part is that the AFs of the store still trust her.

> Or they don't? Future Joel here, salutations. When Klara first enters Mr McBain's barn (don't need to explain what that is here), she curiously says "[...]an AF standing there[the front alcove] proudly at the spot where - no matter what else was said - customers were most likely to look first."

Rosa has been bought, she was so excited. The same with Boy AF Rex and three B3s[^1].

Manager fears I won't get a home, so now I'm in the display window again, alone, on sale.

BEGGAR MAN DIED[^2], THIS BOOKS IS DEPRESSING.

Nevermind, he revived with the nourishment of the Sun, yes.

[^1]: Check model's table.
[^2]: Beggar Man and his dog were two recurring characters that lived outside the magazine and could be seen from the window.

#Josie 

I was moved to the alcove. Josie came back to the store!̶

In an attempt to try to sell a B3 to the Mother, Manager said that the empathy problem had been solved[^1].

> A bit too quick for a major problem like that to be solved.

My fears that Josie would abandon me were disproven. She rejected the B3 and was excited to see me.

Her mother did me a job interview, which I passed with fear. Now I'm Josie's AF, as promised.

#Sun

>[!FAQ] Origin
>It is not clear whether all robots have it or if it is just Klara's reasoning, or  if it is programmed or developed.
>
>The vocabulary used by Josie in paragraphs 73-77 could have implanted the wrong idea that the Sun hides in a specific physical spot.
>> [!CAUTION] Deviations
>> - In a moment from pages 6 to 9 Klara is so immersed in observing the outside world that she forgets the sunlight covering her skin.
>> - At the beginning of Part two Klara conceals the kitchen's skylight to block the Sun's rays, she did this for Josie. And now I wonder, how did Klara cope with the cognitive dissonance of having to take the "goodness" from Josie?

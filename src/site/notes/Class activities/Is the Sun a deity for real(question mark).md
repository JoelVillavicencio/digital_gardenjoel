Why would a superintelligent girl don't know about the Earth's revolution around the Sound? Has the scholar curriculum changed that much?

In [an interview](https://www.waterstones.com/blog/an-exclusive-qanda-with-kazuo-ishiguro-on-klara-and-the-sun), Ishiguro said "our world", so Klara and the Sun isn't a world external to ours. 
He could have said this for simplicity's sake, I don't deny that.

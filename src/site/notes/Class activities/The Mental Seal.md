A directive encompassing any unbreakable idea instilled by the programmers that the robots are forced to believe no matter the circumstances. Like Asimov's Laws of robotics, but subliminal and with more ambiguous intentions.

The perception of smartphones as [[Class activities/Oblongs\|Oblongs]] is the most clear example so far. The [[Sun religion\|Sun religion]] is highly probable to also be imposed by the Mental Seal. It looks like robots that are not Klara are not capable of perceiving negative emotions, but that doesn't make sense, they'd need to appropriately react to children's attitudes. 

Why would the robot makers instil it? What other ideas come with it?

>It doesn't have a name in the book, so I decided to call it the Mental Seal because it is similar of the Mental Seal of Cixin Liu's [Dark Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest) book.

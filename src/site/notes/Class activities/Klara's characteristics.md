> [!TODO] Robotic
> - Solar-powered
> - Needs sleep
> - Aesthetic characteristics: being cute, having hair (At least for female models (paragraphs 63-66))
> - Can feel pain (paragraph 148)
> - Capability of diagnosis (Josie's walk)

>[!EXAMPLE] Model
>- Female
>- Short hair
>- Dark-skinned
>(Or maybe that was her hair? It could be, but I decide to think not because of two reasons: Dark is the most common hair colour, so there'd wouldn't be a need to use it as an identifier unless AFs had a variety of hair colours; short hair hairstyles are usually used with dark hair.
>- Black clothing

>[!DANGER] Unique
>- Every AF is unique
>- She yearns the outside world (not really unique, just uncommon)
>- Very curious 
>- Capability for info absorption
>- No photographic memory (2, paragraph 79)
>- Just wanted to say some random kid confirmed she's cute (2, paragraph 213)

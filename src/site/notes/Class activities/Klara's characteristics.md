>>>[!EXAMPLE] Specific model
>>>- Female
>>>- Short hair
>>>- Dark-skinned
>>>(Or maybe that was her hair? It could be, but I decide to think not because of two reasons: Dark is the most common hair colour, so there'd wouldn't be a need to use it as an identifier unless AFs had a variety of hair colours; short hair hairstyles are usually used with dark hair.
>>>- Black clothing
>>>- A Klara-estimated fifteen years old boy can carry her. Think of that what you wish about her weight.

>- Every AF is unique
>- She yearns the outside world (not really unique, just uncommon)

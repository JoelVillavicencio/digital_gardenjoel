-What Klara noted

Josie ==vomits== and has ==pale feces==. (Part 2, paragraph 26)

Josie gets tired with little physical exercise. (2, paragraph 79), and exhausted for no reason (2, 447).

She ==sleeps== a lot when she is awful (3, 18)

According to doctors, there's a terrible stage that, if survived, lifted people will be ok thereafter.

-Klara on Josie's eyes

It could be that her eyes are pale blue and there's nothing wrong with it, but I put it here just in case it becomes something important.

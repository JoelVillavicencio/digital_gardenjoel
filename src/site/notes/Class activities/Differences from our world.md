Not many, tbh. I suspect that because the newer models are named B3 and not some technical phenomenon like 55WB fx-1784 PLUS B+ SPECIAL V. 17.12.23 PRO, AFs haven't been long enough in this world to be very diverse.

So basically, everything AF-related.

There are some things that are just hyperboles of thing already existing in our world, like the Cooting's machine, which is a symbol of pollution.

Mode is a tad different, that or the twelve-year-old girl with spiky hair is an outlier. In (2, 238) Rick confirms that clothes and restaurants have changed.

I thought that I already got the formula used by Ishiguro in the novel, when BHAM! The mental instability of the mother made the story feel like a thriller for a while, and then WHAM! A chapter that lasts a single day but introduces more characters than the rest of the book combined - and makes me doubt the morality of Klara -. The ending was short, unexpected. I think it was a well done conclusion, nevertheless, after reading some internet forums, I can see my take on the Yard is not popular at all.

### In case you want to read each diary entry individually :

[[Part 3/Beginning to end of Part Three (Pages 89 to 144)\|Beginning to end of Part Three (Pages 89 to 144)]]
[[Part 4/Soleil (Part 4)\|Soleil (Part 4)]]
[[Part 5/太陽 (Part 5)\|太陽 (Part 5)]]
[[Part 6/Dyḗus ph₂tḗr\|Dyḗus ph₂tḗr]]

Ignore the names of the notes, they are more related to personal interpretations than to the contents of the book.

#Adventure

Both the Mother and Josie have become more distant in the last days, Josie can sometimes not say the truth to me now, her smiles are,, different; she felt terribly sick and while Melania is keeping an eye on her and the other on her oblong, I'll go outside alone for the first time.

The Sun has taken so much time in sending his special help (reviving rays) to Josie, so I might need to draw his attention to her case.

___

That wasn't necessary, Josie is less awful now. Rick often comes to see her, at the beginning they were carrying it extremely well, then they started to have doubts and with grudge, Rick stopped coming.

Now Josie has sent me in a mission to apologise to Rick. In his house, he was nicer, or at least he didn't ignore me. I talked to his mother, and she believes she saw Sal alive after her supposed death.

> If this Chekhov's gun is fired, this book could be considered a  psychological thriller.

Helen has a contact to push Rick into Atlas Brookings[^1], the problem is that Rick is not motivated to study hard, he's afraid of many things, mainly of leaving his mother alone. Helen has asked me to convince Josie of convincing Rick of studying hard, now it's one of my missions.

Rick is feeling emotionally better, he'll probably visit Josie's house tomorrow.

Now I'm in my trip to Mr McBain's barn, I became very frightened and Rick had to come to provide assistance. We arrived. Unfortunately, it isn't the Sun's hiding spot, fortunately, it's still one of the last places the Sun sends its rays to before going to rest.

> Klara starts seeing sections of the magazine of the beginning that shouldn't be in the barn. She has become such an unreliable narrator that I feel the need to replace her from now on until she gets out of the barn.
> Klara remembers negative events and takes this as the Sun denying her petition. She says she will destroy the Cootings Machine[^2] and thinks the Sun agrees to help Josie if she does.

Rick and I returned to our homes. The friendship between him and Josie is in excellent conditions after the errand. The Mother has offered to come to the city to meet a guy that is supposed to paint Josie's portrait, Mr Capaldi, and I'm using this opportunity to destroy the Cootings Machine!

Rick and Melania Housekeeper believe that Mr Capaldi is a creep, Melania also thinks that the Mother got messed up after Sal's death, for these reasons, I will be careful around him.

The thinking of having a painted depiction of herself could have given bad thoughts to Josie. A night before going to the city she feared death so much that she needed the Mother to console her.

Now more than ever is time to act, the destruction of the Cootings Machine has become a requirement for Josie's health improvement.

> This part was simple in its settings. We can divide this 55-page-long segment in where - yes, not when - they were in Josie's room, Rick's house and the trip to McBain's barn (and the connective tissue of the preparation for the trip to the city).

#Mappingnarrative 

Works on a brick building with a photo-shoot studio, of course. His workplace has futuristic elements, like a purple door opened with a keypad.

He believes in the potential of AFs, something to do with their advanced intellects.

He has the profile of an [AI whisperer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIQe2jdYAJ0), like Chrissie, the difference lies in that he is extremely competent, in a way that he is more knowledgeable than any modern whisperer.

Furthermore, he tells Chrissie to have faith, then, when she's not convinced, changes the approach and tells her to be rational. This could signal that he is a manipulator, or also that he is just preparing several reasons for a cause he really believes in

In (4, 229), it is suggested that Capaldi could have already replaced a relative of his with an AF.

#Adventure 

First day before _**SOMETHING**_ / 20 Minutes into the Future  

A few hours in a car.

==We have come to the city expecting to meet Mr Capaldi so that he could take more pictures for Josie's portrait and fulfill his desire of meeting an Artificial Friend, me. My main mission is still to destroy the Cootings Machine.==

40 minutes before leaving.

We stayed for a while in the Friend's house, Josie's father arrived not long after. Like Rick, he's good at STEM. Unfortunately, he had less than five minutes to speak to Josie.

Leaving.

The parents are fighting about work decisions, life decisions, current decisions, future decisions. We passed along the Magazine. It doesn't sell AFs anymore.

OTS[^1], the Cootings Machine.

Arriving.

The parents are fighting again.

Mr Capaldi's house is solitary, with no neighbours around. He believes in the potential of AFs, and in Josie not seeing her portrait, which happens not to be a portrait, but her, or rather more accurately an AFisised version of Josie, as I suspected.

> Klara, where did this plot twist come from? How was your thought process?

Josie and the Father are driving away. The mom and I are going to do the same.

Leaving.

Haven't leaved.

Leaving.

Parking.

We're in the place where the Father and Josie are. The parents interchanged places: the Mother wanted to talk with Josie, and the Father wanted to escape Josie's difficult questions.

Engines running.

 Mr Paul wants to talk about the *continuation* of Josie. He says I would have to learn Josie's *heart* to become her. He drove me to the Cootings Machine and easily accepted my plan to destroy it, even seemed convinced enough to drive with drive[^2].
 We found it, it is in a yard! First, Mr Paul chose an awful time to talk about his opinion on Capaldi and the replicability of human consciousness. It's an awful moment because we just have 20 minutes before returning with the Mother and Josie. 
 
We did manage to sabotage the Cootings Machine using some of my P-E-G Nine. I feel... not ok.
Like we had previously arranged, we drove to a sushi cafe to meet the rest of the family.

Helen and Rick are discussing the contact to Atlas Brookings, the Father justifies why he's in an armed community.

We have abandoned the sushi cafe to walk on the street.

Helen and Mr Paul talk about Rick's future, how to make it brighter. A waitress named Cindy says she saw how the magazine turned into a furniture store. The Mother tells me not to take anything said when we were alone too serious. Maybe this would be easier if just everyone looked less abstract and flat.
Never in my short life I have had so many interactions in a single day, or have been in a crowd.
Vance appeared, then Cindy proposed to go to a new AF store to see if the AFs of the old one were brought there, it added up to nothing.

The Mother needs time alone with Josie, I'm staying with the Neighbours until she comes in 30 minutes to collect me. Josie parts away with impaired love, I wonder if she has "figured out" that I'm part of Capaldi's plan.

What ever, we went to a diner. Rick's college interview turned into the remembrance of Miss Helen and Mr Vance's love misadventure. It is unclear whether Mr Vance is on behalf of Rick.

The moder went for us in her car, she left me in the Friend's house and went to ride Miss Helen and Rick to their hotel.

We drove back home from our one-day trip, here are everyone's remarks:

- The Mother: "I was too hard with Paul."
- Miss Helen: "I was expecting too much from Vance. Anyway, he'll probably help us?"
- Rick: "Vance bad; btw, thank you for being supportive, Mrs Arthur."
- Josie: "Nothing's changed..."
- Klara (me): "There's another Cootings Machine. Oh, *bull*, that explains a lot. Here we go again."

![angry anime face.jpg](/img/user/Archives/angry%20anime%20face.jpg)

> I'm amazed this part occurred in a single day. It's the *when* counterpart to the *where* in Part Three. 
> It's also funny that the only part I carried myself to write down the accurate times of every event - something that I'm not repeating because it turned the narration into something dull -, everything happened in the same day. I was very curious about discovering how long each part was to see how long Klara has lived up to this point. I still think she is a few months old, not many years, if even one.

#Sun 13-11-2024 18-11

Josie has never been worse. Maybe my only chance is to go to Mr McBain's barn today, Rick is coming with me as we did in the first time.

Given our experience, the trip went smoothly. The barn is the same as I had left it, with the difference that it had more objects from other places and not only from the Magazine. Like Vance, it is unclear whether the Sun was convinced by the begging.

He was! We were all losing hope with the state of Josie and the diagnosis of Dr Ryan. Everyone was hoping again, one day the Sun poured its special help over Josie, and Josie got better.

#Sun #Adventure #Mappingnarrative #Josie #Thehouse #TimewithManager
![DEATH THE SUN.png](/img/user/Archives/DEATH%20THE%20SUN.png)
Josie and Rick commenced their social lives. I talked with Rick about *that* day, he first believed it was "AF superstition", now, he doesn't know; that was our last talk.

Melania Housekeeper is just Melania, her current state is unknown. New Housekeeper came to The House.

I started occupying the Utility Room as my presence wasn't required anymore.

Mr Capaldi made us a visit, he said that we needed to fight back the unjustified fear of AFs, we needed to *open* the black boxes our thought processes were. The Mother didn't accept to offer Klara. 

The last time I saw Josie, she seemed sad. I know why: AFs come to an end with a slow process where their memories drift through their minds, it is painless, and I would not have wanted it any other way.

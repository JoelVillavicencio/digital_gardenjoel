I am a product in a store. I'm a part of the AF robots, AF seems to be the analog of AI in this world. My peers and I don't tend to see the Sun, so it is a mysterious entity[^2]. 

On my intelligence, It seems I am as intelligent as a human, if not smarter. I was born recently, and I already am capable of fluent speech, complex emotions and self-regulation. Given that I can reason about situations I'm not familiarised with, I'd say I'm a general AI.

AFs describe their condition with emotional vocabulary. We don't say charging, we say "nourishment"; we don't say low battery, we say "sick".

[^1]: This is extra info.
[^2]: Correction: Even when they've already spent time in the Sun, they still treat it with mysticism. It could be that their inicial flawed reasoning escalated into a full-blown religion, or that that kind of reasoning is pre-programmed.

#TimewithManager 

Boy AF Rex is mean to me, even though what he said about getting sick was true, the way in which he expressed himself let me thinking that I did something wrong.

A girl got obsessed with Boy AF Rex, but her mom decided not to take him.

It seems that we AF's might be more than concerned with our capability of charging with the Sun. If we can't get nourishment, we're faulty, and if we're faulty, we'll never get a home.

>Am I the only one seeing similarities with Toy Story? Sentient humanised products suited for kids want to be bought and are not fully active until they get an owner.

Rosa and I got moved to a brighter window with an amazing view of the outside, which I yearn for. I was so distracted by the outside that I almost forgot the Sun.

Rosa stood like a mannequin all day long, unresponsive except when prompted to.

> Toy Story hypothesis reinforced.

I've noted a certain sadness in some kids that come to visit us, Rosa told me not to worry. Manager explained to me that those kids can't afford us, we're a high-end product.

#Josie

We robots have hobbies, we like reading magazines before we go to sleep.

On the fourth day of being in the window I met a girl, she said

>"... I saw _you_, and I thought that's her, the AF I've been looking for!"

On another note, very few AFs were on the outside. Where is everyone that has been bought?

#TimewithManager
Maybe we don't see many AFs because they avoid the magazine, what if they don't want their kids to see newer models that could replace them?

Some of the AFs and kids with AFs don't see happy at all. Finding a child is not a synonym of finding a home.

Rosa is not as good at perceiving emotions as me, especially when people display negative emotions: the kids with their robots, the taxi drivers, the couple.

#Josie 

The girl, which I now know is Josie, and the Mother came to the outside of the magazine to check on me. Josie has problems, but she doesn't know what's exactly wrong, or if there's something wrong. 

> An interesting way of describing what happens to teenagers, or maybe it is something more unexpected that Ishiguro is keeping for another time.

They had to go, and Josie told me we would see each other later.

Today was our last day in the window, I feel we could have disappointed Manager.

#TimewithManager 

Now that I'm in my second period mid-store I get to spend more time with other AFs.

Today a different girl came to the store and tried to choose me, I refused to cooperate and Manager carried her and her dad over to see newer models. Manager told me that she wouldn't help me again and that it is on the customer to decide the AF, not the other way around.

Manager told me that if I was waiting for a kid ("Yes, Josie", I thought to myself), then that kid would probably abandon me and never come back to the store, or come back and choose another AF.

The newer robot models are being exposed in the parts of the magazine that head to the outside. Rosa is repeating to herself what manager said "You are as likely to be chosen mid-store as in the window or the front alcove."

> I'm starting to dislike Manager, at the beginning I thought she was the stereotype of _nice person_, then she started to hide her emotions from the AFs and give defeatist advice as if it was law, or just outright lie. The worst part is that the AFs of the store still trust her.

> Or they don't? Future Joel here, salutations. When Klara first enters Mr McBain's barn (don't need to explain what that is here), she curiously says "[...]an AF standing there[the front alcove] proudly at the spot where - no matter what else was said - customers were most likely to look first."

Rosa has been bought, she was so excited. The same with Boy AF Rex and three B3s[^1].

Manager fears I won't get a home, so now I'm in the display window again, alone, on sale.

BEGGAR MAN DIED[^2], THIS BOOKS IS DEPRESSING.

Nevermind, he revived with the nourishment of the Sun, yes.

#Josie 

I was moved to the alcove. Josie came back to the store!̶

In an attempt to try to sell a B3 to the Mother, Manager said that the empathy problem had been solved[^1].

> A bit too quick for a major problem like that to be solved.

My fears that Josie would abandon me were disproven. She rejected the B3 and was excited to see me.

Her mother did me a job interview, which I passed with fear. Now I'm Josie's AF, as promised.

Melania Housekeeper is not very enthusiastic about my presence, and that's OK with me. I try to be obliging, but it doesn't seem to be working. If it wasn't for Josie's interventions, my dictated behaviour would resemble more what is expected from a piece of furniture rather than a sentient being.

The Mother is an avid believer of the neglectful parenting style. Josie's attachment to her sometimes acts against her well-being.

##### Klara's description of the sky

>"The sky from the bedroom rear window was far larger than the gap of sky at the store - and capable of surprising variations. Sometimes it was the color of the lemons in the fruit bowl, then could turn to the gray of the slate chopping boards. When Josie wasn't well, it could turn the color of her vomit or her pale feces, or even develop streaks of blood. Sometimes the sky would become divided into a series of squares, each one a different shade of purple to its neighbor."

> Is this a highly-figurative lyrical text? Is Klara's perception of colour the same of as a marine mantis's? The real sky isn't divided into squares, never. Probably I'm overthinking this fragment. If when I finish the book without discovering anything weird about it, I'll erase this part, if not, here is a note containing my findings:

> Note: Klara's vision is divided into boxes and that's why she sees the sky like that. I'm surprised I took too long to notice it. If I remember well, they were mentioned since a description Manager in the store.

> Note to the note: [Ishiguro said](https://www.waterstones.com/blog/an-exclusive-qanda-with-kazuo-ishiguro-on-klara-and-the-sun) she sees the world in boxes in moments of confusion or stress.

I'm used to seeing the sunset with Josie, it's our special moment.

Today we're going to check the spatial accommodation of the rooms of the house from the outside, we've been discussing it and finally her or my point is going to be proven with this new evidence.

Her tutoring didn't go well, but that just made her happier when she headed to me. Melania Housekeeper accompanied us to the outside.

Josie's friend, Rick, was there, he created an artificial flock and was testing it. Like Melania Housekeeper, he didn't seem to enjoy my presence.

They're meeting on Tuesday, I wonder what will happen.

> ""I wonder when it was Josie went there""
> ""It's very nice to meet Rick""

> Klara talks to people in third person, how curious[^1].

[^1]: This is very interesting, I first thought AFs did this with humans to identify themselves as Afs, something coming with [[Class activities/The Mental Seal\|The Mental Seal]][^2]. I was wrong, later when Klara does an impression of Josie, she is capable of speaking in the second person. She tends to speak about herself in the third person too (4, 370).

[^2]: By the way, this theory is falling into pieces as I advance through the book.

The party is to please Mother because she thinks that Josie needs to socialise more. 

Some drama occurred, I don't get it due to lack of context, I'll update once I've got new info.

Well, the Sun is being the Sun, pouring his nourishment into some kids.

Josie turned to some girl and Rick is by himself, everyone is being nice to him, in a condescending way. Josie's angry, towards Rick, or towards the girls that started a conversation with him? I don't know.

Josie distracted everyone by introducing me.

> That was easier than expected.

Her "friends" started toying with me and Josie, moved by peer pressure, she said she would have preferred to buy a B3.

> This event is a similar level of sadness to the dead of Beggar Man.

They would have turned me into a failed gymnast, fortunately, Rick came to defend me with some counterbullying.

Now we're the only ones in the room. He doesn't feel like he belongs here, he is not a lifted kid.

Josie hasn't shown signs of meanness in the last few days.

Josie had a minor health problem related to bad sleep, her mother encouraged her to stop drinking energy drinks.

> I can't take out of my head, Josie drinking Red Bull or Monster Energy. If I ever do a fanart of her, take for granted there's going to be a Red Bull in the background.

We're going to Morgan's Falls[^1] by Sunday if everything goes well.

Now I understand why the Mother was so sad when Sal being mentioned in the meeting caused drama, she appears in an old photo and Josie said it's her sister who died.

I think the mother doubts I have emotions, just because I'm mannered and obliging doesn't mean I don't have emotions. So far, I have showed signs of all emotions except for very strong ones like rage or euphoria. And, of course, there are emotions like hangry or couple's love that couldn't happen in a being like me.

> Klara, I'm not a doctor, and I'm still going to say this. Have you considered you show signs of Aspergers?

> On another note, maybe AFs could be hangry when they don't get the Sun's nourishment.

>"... the danger topics were themselves ways the Mother had devised to make certain emotions appear inside Josie's mind."

Nevermind, this is a sad book and Josie got sick again, so we won't go.

There's a twist to the twist and I can go with the mother without Josie, which is suspicious.

> How interesting that the Mother remarks Josie was toying with her feelings by saying Klara wanted to do this. It's a reasonable observation, I would only suggest her to tell that to her daughter and not some indirect response of "then Klara is going". Unless she's scheming something....

At least I suspect the Mother sincerely wants to be with Josie. I corrected her when she said, again, I didn't have feeling.

> Well done, Klara. Let's not create unnecessary confusion.

The mother says we're friends, something totally unexpected.

> Like when a self-insert gets praised by the characters of a fictional world, but I suspect a Nobel Prize in Literature wouldn't do that.

We just arrived to our destination, I'm happy to see several other AFs here. I know I would enjoy this more if Mother didn't make me to act like Josie.

> Eeriness is reaching new highs in this book.

We returned home, Josie's drawing. Throughout my experience in this house I've gathered info about my human. The conclusion: she has a bull ton of problems!

I thought that I already got the formula used by Ishiguro in the novel, when BHAM! The mental instability of the mother made the story feel like a thriller for a while, and then WHAM! A chapter that lasts a single day but introduces more characters than the rest of the book combined - and makes me doubt the morality of Klara -. The ending was short, unexpected. I think it was a well done conclusion, nevertheless, after reading some internet forums, I can see my take on the Yard is not popular at all.

#Adventure

Both the Mother and Josie have become more distant in the last days, Josie can sometimes not say the truth to me now, her smiles are,, different; she felt terribly sick and while Melania is keeping an eye on her and the other on her oblong, I'll go outside alone for the first time.

The Sun has taken so much time in sending his special help (reviving rays) to Josie, so I might need to draw his attention to her case.

___

That wasn't necessary, Josie is less awful now. Rick often comes to see her, at the beginning they were carrying it extremely well, then they started to have doubts and with grudge, Rick stopped coming.

Now Josie has sent me in a mission to apologise to Rick. In his house, he was nicer, or at least he didn't ignore me. I talked to his mother, and she believes she saw Sal alive after her supposed death.

> If this Chekhov's gun is fired, this book could be considered a  psychological thriller.

Helen has a contact to push Rick into Atlas Brookings[^1], the problem is that Rick is not motivated to study hard, he's afraid of many things, mainly of leaving his mother alone. Helen has asked me to convince Josie of convincing Rick of studying hard, now it's one of my missions.

Rick is feeling emotionally better, he'll probably visit Josie's house tomorrow.

Now I'm in my trip to Mr McBain's barn, I became very frightened and Rick had to come to provide assistance. We arrived. Unfortunately, it isn't the Sun's hiding spot, fortunately, it's still one of the last places the Sun sends its rays to before going to rest.

> Klara starts seeing sections of the magazine of the beginning that shouldn't be in the barn. She has become such an unreliable narrator that I feel the need to replace her from now on until she gets out of the barn.
> Klara remembers negative events and takes this as the Sun denying her petition. She says she will destroy the Cootings Machine[^2] and thinks the Sun agrees to help Josie if she does.

Rick and I returned to our homes. The friendship between him and Josie is in excellent conditions after the errand. The Mother has offered to come to the city to meet a guy that is supposed to paint Josie's portrait, Mr Capaldi, and I'm using this opportunity to destroy the Cootings Machine!

Rick and Melania Housekeeper believe that Mr Capaldi is a creep, Melania also thinks that the Mother got messed up after Sal's death, for these reasons, I will be careful around him.

The thinking of having a painted depiction of herself could have given bad thoughts to Josie. A night before going to the city she feared death so much that she needed the Mother to console her.

Now more than ever is time to act, the destruction of the Cootings Machine has become a requirement for Josie's health improvement.

> This part was simple in its settings. We can divide this 55-page-long segment in where - yes, not when - they were in Josie's room, Rick's house and the trip to McBain's barn (and the connective tissue of the preparation for the trip to the city).

#Mappingnarrative 

Works on a brick building with a photo-shoot studio, of course. His workplace has futuristic elements, like a purple door opened with a keypad.

He believes in the potential of AFs, something to do with their advanced intellects.

He has the profile of an [AI whisperer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIQe2jdYAJ0), like Chrissie, the difference lies in that he is extremely competent, in a way that he is more knowledgeable than any modern whisperer.

Furthermore, he tells Chrissie to have faith, then, when she's not convinced, changes the approach and tells her to be rational. This could signal that he is a manipulator, or also that he is just preparing several reasons for a cause he really believes in

In (4, 229), it is suggested that Capaldi could have already replaced a relative of his with an AF.

#Adventure 

First day before _**SOMETHING**_ / 20 Minutes into the Future  

A few hours in a car.

==We have come to the city expecting to meet Mr Capaldi so that he could take more pictures for Josie's portrait and fulfill his desire of meeting an Artificial Friend, me. My main mission is still to destroy the Cootings Machine.==

40 minutes before leaving.

We stayed for a while in the Friend's house, Josie's father arrived not long after. Like Rick, he's good at STEM. Unfortunately, he had less than five minutes to speak to Josie.

Leaving.

The parents are fighting about work decisions, life decisions, current decisions, future decisions. We passed along the Magazine. It doesn't sell AFs anymore.

OTS[^1], the Cootings Machine.

Arriving.

The parents are fighting again.

Mr Capaldi's house is solitary, with no neighbours around. He believes in the potential of AFs, and in Josie not seeing her portrait, which happens not to be a portrait, but her, or rather more accurately an AFisised version of Josie, as I suspected.

> Klara, where did this plot twist come from? How was your thought process?

Josie and the Father are driving away. The mom and I are going to do the same.

Leaving.

Haven't leaved.

Leaving.

Parking.

We're in the place where the Father and Josie are. The parents interchanged places: the Mother wanted to talk with Josie, and the Father wanted to escape Josie's difficult questions.

Engines running.

 Mr Paul wants to talk about the *continuation* of Josie. He says I would have to learn Josie's *heart* to become her. He drove me to the Cootings Machine and easily accepted my plan to destroy it, even seemed convinced enough to drive with drive[^2].
 We found it, it is in a yard! First, Mr Paul chose an awful time to talk about his opinion on Capaldi and the replicability of human consciousness. It's an awful moment because we just have 20 minutes before returning with the Mother and Josie. 
 
We did manage to sabotage the Cootings Machine using some of my P-E-G Nine. I feel... not ok.
Like we had previously arranged, we drove to a sushi cafe to meet the rest of the family.

Helen and Rick are discussing the contact to Atlas Brookings, the Father justifies why he's in an armed community.

We have abandoned the sushi cafe to walk on the street.

Helen and Mr Paul talk about Rick's future, how to make it brighter. A waitress named Cindy says she saw how the magazine turned into a furniture store. The Mother tells me not to take anything said when we were alone too serious. Maybe this would be easier if just everyone looked less abstract and flat.
Never in my short life I have had so many interactions in a single day, or have been in a crowd.
Vance appeared, then Cindy proposed to go to a new AF store to see if the AFs of the old one were brought there, it added up to nothing.

The Mother needs time alone with Josie, I'm staying with the Neighbours until she comes in 30 minutes to collect me. Josie parts away with impaired love, I wonder if she has "figured out" that I'm part of Capaldi's plan.

What ever, we went to a diner. Rick's college interview turned into the remembrance of Miss Helen and Mr Vance's love misadventure. It is unclear whether Mr Vance is on behalf of Rick.

The moder went for us in her car, she left me in the Friend's house and went to ride Miss Helen and Rick to their hotel.

We drove back home from our one-day trip, here are everyone's remarks:

- The Mother: "I was too hard with Paul."
- Miss Helen: "I was expecting too much from Vance. Anyway, he'll probably help us?"
- Rick: "Vance bad; btw, thank you for being supportive, Mrs Arthur."
- Josie: "Nothing's changed..."
- Klara (me): "There's another Cootings Machine. Oh, *bull*, that explains a lot. Here we go again."

![angry anime face.jpg](/img/user/Archives/angry%20anime%20face.jpg)

> I'm amazed this part occurred in a single day. It's the *when* counterpart to the *where* in Part Three. 
> It's also funny that the only part I carried myself to write down the accurate times of every event - something that I'm not repeating because it turned the narration into something dull -, everything happened in the same day. I was very curious about discovering how long each part was to see how long Klara has lived up to this point. I still think she is a few months old, not many years, if even one.

#Sun 13-11-2024 18-11

Josie has never been worse. Maybe my only chance is to go to Mr McBain's barn today, Rick is coming with me as we did in the first time.

Given our experience, the trip went smoothly. The barn is the same as I had left it, with the difference that it had more objects from other places and not only from the Magazine. Like Vance, it is unclear whether the Sun was convinced by the begging.

He was! We were all losing hope with the state of Josie and the diagnosis of Dr Ryan. Everyone was hoping again, one day the Sun poured its special help over Josie, and Josie got better.

Josie and Rick commenced their social lives. I talked with Rick about *that* day, he first believed it was "AF superstition", now, he doesn't know; that was our last talk.

Melania Housekeeper is just Melania, her current state is unknown. New Housekeeper came to The House.

I started occupying the Utility Room as my presence wasn't required anymore.

Mr Capaldi made us a visit, he said that we needed to fight back the unjustified fear of AFs, we needed to *open* the black boxes our thought processes were. The Mother didn't accept to offer Klara. 

The last time I saw Josie, she seemed sad. I know why: AFs come to an end with a slow process where their memories drift through their minds, it is painless, and I would not have wanted it any other way.

The term robots use for smartphones.

> "Press their oblongs", says Klara in paragraph 41, denoting that she doesn't know what smartphones are used for.

Klara's smart enough to identify ordinary objects: sports shoes, office paraphernalia, bricks, a tow-away zone, a pedestrian crossing, etc. She hasn't had personal experiences with these objects yet, why would she have had? She has only lived for a few days. So, in order to understand their function and context, she should have preloaded knowledge, as hypothesised in [[Part 1/Klara's presentation and sapience  (Pages 1 to 3)\|Klara's presentation and sapience  (Pages 1 to 3)]].

By consequent, that knowledge is hand-picked by the programmers who made her. Even if she didn't know what a cellphone is, she could quickly deduce it with her outstanding logical abilities. There must be an implanted impediment that distorts her perception and/or understanding of smartphones.

In Part two, paragraph 2 Klara identifies a sketchpad, so not all cellphone-like devices are made oblongs by her programming.

Later, on paragraph 62, she shows that she knows when oblongs are turned off or on. She deduced that Josie was with her tutor from the noise of her headset, not anything related to the phone.

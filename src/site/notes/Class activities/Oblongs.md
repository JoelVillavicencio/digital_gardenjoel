The term robots use for smartphones.

> "Press their oblongs", says Klara in paragraph 41, denoting that she doesn't know what smartphones are used for.

Klara's smart enough to identify ordinary objects: sports shoes, office paraphernalia, bricks, a tow-away zone, a pedestrian crossing, etc. She hasn't had personal experiences with these objects yet, why would she have had? She has only lived for a few days. So, in order to understand their function and context, she should have preloaded knowledge, as hypothesised in [[Part 1/Klara's presentation and sapience  (Pages 1 to 3)\|Klara's presentation and sapience  (Pages 1 to 3)]].

By consequent, that knowledge is hand-picked by the programmers who made her. Even if she didn't know what a cellphone is, she could quickly deduce it with her outstanding logical abilities. There must be an implanted impediment that distorts her perception and/or understanding of smartphones.

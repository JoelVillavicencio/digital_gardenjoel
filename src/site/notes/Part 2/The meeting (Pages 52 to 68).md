The party is to please Mother because she thinks that Josie needs to socialise more. 

Some drama occurred, I don't get it due to lack of context, I'll update once I've got new info.

Well, the Sun is being the Sun, pouring his nourishment into some kids.

Josie turned to some girl and Rick is by himself, everyone is being nice to him, in a condescending way. Josie's angry, towards Rick, towards the girls that started a conversation with him? I don't know.

Josie distracted everyone by introducing me.

> That was easier than expected.

Her "friends" started toying with me and Josie, moved by peer pressure, said she would have preferred to buy a B3.

> This event is a similar level of sadness to the dead of Beggar Man.

They would have turned me into a failed gymnast, fortunately, Rick came to defend me with some counterbullying.

Now we're the only ones in the room. He doesn't feel like he belongs here, he is not a lifted kid.

I'm used to seeing the sunset with Josie, it's our special moment.

Today we're going to check the spatial accommodation of the rooms of the house from the outside, we've been discussing it and finally her or my point is going to be proven with this new evidence.

Her tutoring didn't go well, but that just made her happier when she headed to me. Melania Housekeeper accompanied us to the outside.

Josie's friend, Rick, was there, he created an artificial flock and was testing it. Like Melania Housekeeper, he didn't seem to enjoy my presence.

They're meeting on Tuesday, I wonder what will happen.

> ""I wonder when it was Josie went there""
> ""It's very nice to meet Rick""

> Klara talks to people in third person, how curious[^1].

[^1]: This is very interesting, I first thought AFs did this with humans to identify themselves as Afs, something coming with [[Class activities/The Mental Seal\|The Mental Seal]][^2]. I was wrong, later when Klara does an impression of Josie, she is capable of speaking in the second person. She tends to speak about herself in the third person too (4, 370).

[^2]: By the way, this theory is falling into pieces as I advance through the book.

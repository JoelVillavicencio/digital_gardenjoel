Nevermind, this is a sad book and Josie got sick again, so we won't go.

There's a twist to the twist and I can go with the mother without Josie, which is suspicious.

> How interesting that the Mother remarks Josie was toying with her feelings by saying Klara wanted to do this. It's a reasonable observation, I would only suggest her to tell that to her daughter and not some indirect response of "then Klara is going". Unless she's scheming something....

At least I suspect the Mother sincerely wants to be with Josie. I corrected her when she said again I didn't have feeling.

> Well done, Klara. Let's not create unnecessary confusion.

The mother says we're friends, something totally unexpected.

> Like when a self-insert gets praised by the characters of a fictional world, but I suspect a Nobel Prize in Literature wouldn't do that.

We just arrived to our destination, I'm happy to see several other AFs here. I know I would enjoy this more if Mother didn't make me to act like Josie.

> Eeriness is reaching new highs in this book.

We returned home, Josie's drawing. Throughout my experience in this house I've gathered info about my human. The conclusion: she has a bull ton of problems!

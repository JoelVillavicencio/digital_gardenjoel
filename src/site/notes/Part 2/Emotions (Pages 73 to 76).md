I think the mother doubts I have emotions, just because I'm mannered and obliging doesn't mean I don't have emotions. So far, I have showed signs of all emotions except for very strong ones like rage or euphoria. And, of course, there are emotions like hangry or couple's love that couldn't happen in a being like me.

> On another note, maybe AFs could be hangry when they don't get the Sun's nourishment.

>"... the danger topics were themselves ways the Mother had devised to make certain emotions appear inside Josie's mind."

Melania Housekeeper is not very enthusiastic about my presence, and that's OK with me. I try to ingratiate, but it doesn't seem to be working. If it wasn't for Josie's interventions, my dictated behaviour would resemble more what is expected from a piece of furniture rather than a sentient being.

The Mother is an avid believer of the neglectful parenting style. Josie's attachment to her sometimes act against her well-being.



##### Klara's description of the sky
>"The sky from the bedroom rear window was far larger than the gap of sky at the store - and capable of surprising variations. Sometimes it was the color of the lemons in the fruit bowl, then could turn to the gray of the slate chopping boards. When Josie wasn't well, it could turn the color of her vomit or her pale feces, or even develop streaks of blood. Sometimes the sky would become divided into a series of squares, each one a different shade of purple to its neighbor."

> Is this a highly-figurative lyrical text? Is Klara's perception of colour the same of as a marine mantis's? The real sky isn't divided into squares, never. Probably I'm overthinking this fragment. If when I finish the book without discovering anything weird about it, I'll erase this part, if not, here is a note containing my findings.

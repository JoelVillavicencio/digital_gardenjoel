Josie hasn't shown signs of meanness in the last few days.

Josie had a minor health problem related to bad sleep, her mother encouraged her to stop drinking energy drinks.

> I can't take out of my head, Josie drinking Red Bull or Monster Energy. If I ever do a fanart of her, take for granted there's going to be a Red Bull in the background.

We're going to Morgan's Falls[^1] by Sunday if everything goes well.

Now I understand why the Mother was so sad when Sal being mentioned in the meeting caused drama, she appears in an old photo and Josie said it's her sister who died.

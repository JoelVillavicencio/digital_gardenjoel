For this part, the Mental map's branches got updated, erased and divided several times. The most significant addition was the creation of a completely new section named The House, which explains the mechanics of the Arthur family with bullet points and relation arrows.

Melania Housekeeper is not very enthusiastic about my presence, and that's OK with me. I try to be obliging, but it doesn't seem to be working. If it wasn't for Josie's interventions, my dictated behaviour would resemble more what is expected from a piece of furniture rather than a sentient being.

The Mother is an avid believer of the neglectful parenting style. Josie's attachment to her sometimes acts against her well-being.

##### Klara's description of the sky

>"The sky from the bedroom rear window was far larger than the gap of sky at the store - and capable of surprising variations. Sometimes it was the color of the lemons in the fruit bowl, then could turn to the gray of the slate chopping boards. When Josie wasn't well, it could turn the color of her vomit or her pale feces, or even develop streaks of blood. Sometimes the sky would become divided into a series of squares, each one a different shade of purple to its neighbor."

> Is this a highly-figurative lyrical text? Is Klara's perception of colour the same of as a marine mantis's? The real sky isn't divided into squares, never. Probably I'm overthinking this fragment. If when I finish the book without discovering anything weird about it, I'll erase this part, if not, here is a note containing my findings:

> Note: Klara's vision is divided into boxes and that's why she sees the sky like that. I'm surprised I took too long to notice it. If I remember well, they were mentioned since a description Manager in the store.

> Note to the note: [Ishiguro said](https://www.waterstones.com/blog/an-exclusive-qanda-with-kazuo-ishiguro-on-klara-and-the-sun) she sees the world in boxes in moments of confusion or stress.

I'm used to seeing the sunset with Josie, it's our special moment.

Today we're going to check the spatial accommodation of the rooms of the house from the outside, we've been discussing it and finally her or my point is going to be proven with this new evidence.

Her tutoring didn't go well, but that just made her happier when she headed to me. Melania Housekeeper accompanied us to the outside.

Josie's friend, Rick, was there, he created an artificial flock and was testing it. Like Melania Housekeeper, he didn't seem to enjoy my presence.

They're meeting on Tuesday, I wonder what will happen.

> ""I wonder when it was Josie went there""
> ""It's very nice to meet Rick""

> Klara talks to people in third person, how curious[^1].

[^1]: This is very interesting, I first thought AFs did this with humans to identify themselves as Afs, something coming with [[Class activities/The Mental Seal\|The Mental Seal]][^2]. I was wrong, later when Klara does an impression of Josie, she is capable of speaking in the second person.

[^2]: By the way, this theory is falling into pieces as I advance through the book.

The party is to please Mother because she thinks that Josie needs to socialise more. 

Some drama occurred, I don't get it due to lack of context, I'll update once I've got new info.

Well, the Sun is being the Sun, pouring his nourishment into some kids.

Josie turned to some girl and Rick is by himself, everyone is being nice to him, in a condescending way. Josie's angry, towards Rick, or towards the girls that started a conversation with him? I don't know.

Josie distracted everyone by introducing me.

> That was easier than expected.

Her "friends" started toying with me and Josie, moved by peer pressure, she said she would have preferred to buy a B3.

> This event is a similar level of sadness to the dead of Beggar Man.

They would have turned me into a failed gymnast, fortunately, Rick came to defend me with some counterbullying.

Now we're the only ones in the room. He doesn't feel like he belongs here, he is not a lifted kid.

Josie hasn't shown signs of meanness in the last few days.

Josie had a minor health problem related to bad sleep, her mother encouraged her to stop drinking energy drinks.

> I can't take out of my head, Josie drinking Red Bull or Monster Energy. If I ever do a fanart of her, take for granted there's going to be a Red Bull in the background.

We're going to Morgan's Falls[^1] by Sunday if everything goes well.

Now I understand why the Mother was so sad when Sal being mentioned in the meeting caused drama, she appears in an old photo and Josie said it's her sister who died.

I think the mother doubts I have emotions, just because I'm mannered and obliging doesn't mean I don't have emotions. So far, I have showed signs of all emotions except for very strong ones like rage or euphoria. And, of course, there are emotions like hangry or couple's love that couldn't happen in a being like me.

> Klara, I'm not a doctor, and I'm still going to say this. Have you considered you show signs of Aspergers?

> On another note, maybe AFs could be hangry when they don't get the Sun's nourishment.

>"... the danger topics were themselves ways the Mother had devised to make certain emotions appear inside Josie's mind."

>This quote has a similar punch to the description of teenagers mentioned in [[Part 1/Her name is Josie (Pages 20 to 24)\|Her name is Josie (Pages 20 to 24)]]

Today we're going to Morgan's Falls!

Nevermind, this is a sad book and Josie got sick again, so we won't go.

There's a twist to the twist and I can go with the mother without Josie, which is suspicious.

> How interesting that the Mother remarks Josie was toying with her feelings by saying Klara wanted to do this. It's a reasonable observation, I would only suggest her to tell that to her daughter and not some indirect response of "then Klara is going". Unless she's scheming something....

At least I suspect the Mother sincerely wants to be with Josie. I corrected her when she said again I didn't have feeling.

> Well done, Klara. Let's not create unnecessary confusion.

The mother says we're friends, something totally unexpected.

> Like when a self-insert gets praised by the characters of a fictional world, but I suspect a Nobel Prize in Literature wouldn't do that.

We just arrived to our destination, I'm happy to see several other AFs here. I know I would enjoy this more if Mother didn't make me to act like Josie.

> Eeriness is reaching new highs in this book.

We returned home, Josie's drawing. Throughout my experience in this house I've gathered info about my human. The conclusion: she has a bull ton of problems!

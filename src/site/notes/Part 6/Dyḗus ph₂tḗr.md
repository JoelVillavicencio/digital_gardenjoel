Josie and Rick commenced their social lives. I talked with Rick about *that* day, he first believed it was "AF superstition", now, he doesn't know; that was our last talk.

Melania Housekeeper is just Melania, her current state is unknown. New Housekeeper came to The House.

I started occupying the Utility Room as my presence wasn't required anymore.

Mr Capaldi made us a visit, he said that we needed to fight back the unjustified fear of AFs, we needed to *open* the black boxes our thought processes were. The Mother didn't accept to offer Klara. 

The last time I saw Josie, she seemed sad. I know why: AFs come to an end with a slow process where their memories drift through their minds, it is painless, and I would not have wanted it any other way.

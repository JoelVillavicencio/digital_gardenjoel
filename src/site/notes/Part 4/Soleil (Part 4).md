#Adventure 

First day before _**SOMETHING**_ / 20 Minutes into the Future  

A few hours in a car.

==We have come to the city expecting to meet Mr Capaldi so that he could take more pictures for Josie's portrait and fulfill his desire of meeting an Artificial Friend, me. My main mission is still to destroy the Cootings Machine.==

40 minutes before leaving.

We stayed for a while in the Friend's house, Josie's father arrived not long after. Like Rick, he's good at STEM. Unfortunately, he had less than five minutes to speak to Josie.

Leaving.

The parents are fighting about work decisions, life decisions, current decisions, future decisions. We passed along the Magazine. It doesn't sell AFs anymore.

OTS[^1], the Cootings Machine.

Arriving.

The parents are fighting again.

Mr Capaldi's house is solitary, with no neighbours around. He believes in the potential of AFs, and in Josie not seeing her portrait, which happens not to be a portrait, but her, or rather more accurately an AFisised version of Josie, as I suspected.

> Klara, where did this plot twist come from? How was your thought process?

Josie and the Father are driving away. The mom and I are going to do the same.

Leaving.

Haven't leaved.

Leaving.

Parking.

We're in the place where the Father and Josie are. The parents interchanged places: the Mother wanted to talk with Josie, and the Father wanted to escape Josie's difficult questions.

Engines running.

 Mr Paul wants to talk about the *continuation* of Josie. He says I would have to learn Josie's *heart* to become her. He drove me to the Cootings Machine and easily accepted my plan to destroy it, even seemed convinced enough to drive with drive[^2].
 We found it, it is in a yard! First, Mr Paul chose an awful time to talk about his opinion on Capaldi and the replicability of human consciousness. It's an awful moment because we just have 20 minutes before returning with the Mother and Josie. 
 
We did manage to sabotage the Cootings Machine using some of my P-E-G Nine. I feel... not ok.
Like we had previously arranged, we drove to a sushi cafe to meet the rest of the family.

Helen and Rick are discussing the contact to Atlas Brookings, the Father justifies why he's in an armed community.

We have abandoned the sushi cafe to walk on the street.

Helen and Mr Paul talk about Rick's future, how to make it brighter. A waitress named Cindy says she saw how the magazine turned into a furniture store. The Mother tells me not to take anything said when we were alone too serious. Maybe this would be easier if just everyone looked less abstract and flat.
Never in my short life I have had so many interactions in a single day, or have been in a crowd.
Vance appeared, then Cindy proposed to go to a new AF store to see if the AFs of the old one were brought there, it added up to nothing.

The Mother needs time alone with Josie, I'm staying with the Neighbours until she comes in 30 minutes to collect me. Josie parts away with impaired love, I wonder if she has "figured out" that I'm part of Capaldi's plan.

What ever, we went to a diner. Rick's college interview turned into the remembrance of Miss Helen and Mr Vance's love misadventure. It is unclear whether Mr Vance is on behalf of Rick.

The moder went for us in her car, she left me in the Friend's house and went to ride Miss Helen and Rick to their hotel.

We drove back home from our one-day trip, here are everyone's remarks:

- The Mother: "I was too hard with Paul."
- Miss Helen: "I was expecting too much from Vance. Anyway, he'll probably help us?"
- Rick: "Vance bad; btw, thank you for being supportive, Mrs Arthur."
- Josie: "Nothing's changed..."
- Klara (me): "There's another Cootings Machine. Oh, *bull*, that explains a lot. Here we go again."

> I'm amazed this part occurred in a single day. It's the *when* counterpart to the *where* in Part Three. 
> It's also funny that the only part I carried myself to write down the accurate times of every event - something that I'm not repeating because it turned the narration into something dull -, everything happened in the same day. I was very curious about discovering how long each part was to see how long Klara has lived up to this point. I still think she is a few months old, not many years, if even one.

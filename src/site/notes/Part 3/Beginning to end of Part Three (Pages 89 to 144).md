#Sun 

Both the Mother and Josie have become more distant in the lasta days, Josie can sometimes not say the truth to me now, her smiles are,, different; she felt terribly sick and while Melania is keeping an eye on her and the other on her oblong, I'll go outside alone for the first time.

The Sun has taken so much time in sending his reviving rays to Josie, so I might need to draw his attention to her case.

___

That wasn't necessary, Josie is less awful now. Rick often comes to see her, at the beginning they were carrying it extremely well, then they started to have doubts and with grudge, Rick stopped coming.

Now Josie has sent me in a mission to apologise to Rick. In his house, he was nicer, or at least he didn't ignore me. I talked to his mother, and she believes she saw Sal alive after her supposed death.

> If this Chekhov's gun is fired, this book could be considered a  psychological thriller

Helen has a contact to push Rick into Atlas Brookings, the problem is that Rick is not motivated to study hard, he's afraid of many things, mainly of leaving his mother alone. Helen has asked me to convince Josie of convincing Rick of studying hard, now it's one of my missions.

Rick is feeling emotionally better, he'll probably visit Josie's house tomorrow.

Now I'm in my trip to Mr McBain's barn, I became very frightened and Rick had to come to provide assistance. We arrived. Unfortunately, it isn't the Sun's hiding spot, fortunately, it's still one of the last places the Sun sends its rays to before going to rest.

> Klara starts seeing sections of the magazine of the beginning that shouldn't be in the barn. She has become such an unreliable narrator that I feel the need to replace her from now on until she gets out of the barn.
> Klara remembers negative events and takes this as the Sun denying her petition. She says she will destroy the Cootings Machine[^1] and thinks the Sun agrees to help Josie if she does.

Rick and I returned to our homes. The friendship between him and Josie is in excellent conditions after the errand. The Mother has offered to come to the city to meet a guy that is supposed to paint Josie's portrait, Mr Capaldi, and I'm using this opportunity to destroy the Cootings Machine!

Rick and Melania Housekeeper believe that Mr Capaldi is a creep, Melania also thinks that the Mother got messed up after Sal's death, for these reasons, I will be careful around him.

The thinking of having a painted depiction of herself could have given bad thoughts to Josie. A night before going to the city she feared death so much that she needed the Mother to console her.

Now more than ever is time to act, the destruction of the Cootings Machine has become a requirement for Josie's health improvement.

> This part was simple in its settings. We can divide this 55-page-long segment in where - yes, not when - they were in Josie's room, Rick's house and the trip to McBain's barn (and the connective tissue of the preparation for the trip to the city).

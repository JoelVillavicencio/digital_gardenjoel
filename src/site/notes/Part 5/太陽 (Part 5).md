Josie has never been worse. Maybe my only chance is to go to Mr McBain's barn today, Rick is coming with me as we did in the first time.

Given our experience, the trip went smoothly. The barn is the same as I had left it, with the difference that it had more objects from other places and not only from the Magazine. Like Vance, it is unclear whether the Sun was convinced by the begging.

He was! We were all losing hope with the state of Josie and the diagnosis of Dr Ryan. Everyone was hoping again, one day the Sun poured its special help over Josie, and Josie got better.
